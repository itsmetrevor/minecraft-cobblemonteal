# Installation

* Download ATLauncher from [https://atlauncher.com/downloads](https://atlauncher.com/downloads)
  * Alternatively, download or use another launcher that can import MultiMC packs of your own preference.
  * I mainly suggest ATLauncher because it automatically downloads and installs a compatible Java version.
* Install ATLauncher making sure to leave the Install Java 17 (for ATLauncher) option checked.
* After ATLauncher launches, go to "Accounts" on the right side menu, and add your Mojang or Microsoft account.
* Go to "Instances" on the right side menu, then click the import button in the upper left.
* Copy and paste the following URL into the URL field: `https://github.com/itsmetrevor/minecraft-cobblemonteal/releases/download/MMCPack/Cobblemon.Teal.zip`
* Click the Import button, input a name for the pack (or leave it as the "Cobblemon Teal" default).
* Click the Play button on the newly imported Cobblemon Teal instance, wait for the mods to be downloaded and installed, and play the game!
  * If anything fails to download, cancel the launch and try again.


If you're a friend of mine, be sure to ask me for my Cobblemon Teal server address on Discord!

This pack does include a proximity chat mod, so be sure to unmute your mic after you join a server!
